### What I learned

It's quite a long ago since I made my last project using HTML, CSS & JS as I'm more writing React Application these days. But It's nice to fall back to the core and do some fun projects to test your skills & I'm not hisitant to say that while doing the project I came across some challenges with JS but I tried my level best solve those challenges on my own & while figuring out the solution for those challenges I got to learn some new stuff as well.
